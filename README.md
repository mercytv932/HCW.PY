High Card Wins (HCW) is a console-based Python card game where a player competes against the CPU using a standard 52-card deck. In each round, both the player and the CPU draw a random card, and the higher-ranked card wins the round. Card rankings follow traditional values, with King as the highest card and Ace as the lowest.

The game runs for up to 15 rounds or ends early if two ties occur. Players can interact during gameplay by pressing Enter to draw a card, typing DECK to view the remaining cards in the deck, or typing SCORE to check the current round totals. Tied rounds discard both cards and replay the round.

This project demonstrates core Python concepts such as dictionaries, lists, functions, loops, conditionals, user input handling, and basic game logic. It’s a great example of procedural programming and working with randomized data in Python.
